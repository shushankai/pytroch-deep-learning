# PyTorch Deep Learning - Zero to Mastery Course Notebooks

Welcome! This repository contains my hands-on code and notes as I follow the [Zero to Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://learnpytorch.io/) course by Daniel Bourke. The course is designed for beginners and covers PyTorch fundamentals, neural network classification, computer vision, custom datasets, experiment tracking, model deployment, and transfer learning.

---

## üìö Course Structure

The course is project-based and code-first, focusing on experimentation and practical understanding. All code is written in Jupyter Notebooks (or Google Colab). You‚Äôll find annotated notebooks for each major section of the course.

### Main Sections Covered

- **00 - PyTorch Fundamentals**: Core PyTorch operations and tensors.
- **01 - PyTorch Workflow**: Building and training neural networks.
- **02 - Neural Network Classification**: End-to-end binary and multiclass classification.
- **03 - Computer Vision**: Using PyTorch for image data.
- **04 - Custom Datasets**: Loading and working with your own data.
- **05 - Going Modular**: Structuring PyTorch code for real-world projects.
- **06 - Transfer Learning**: Using pre-trained models for new tasks.
- **07-09 - Milestone Projects**: Experiment tracking, paper replication, and model deployment.
