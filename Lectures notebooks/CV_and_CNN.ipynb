    "| **Topic** | **Contents** |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| **0. Computer vision libraries in PyTorch** | PyTorch has a bunch of built-in helpful computer vision libraries, let's check them out.  |\n",
    "| **1. Load data** | To practice computer vision, we'll start with some images of different pieces of clothing from [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). |\n",
    "| **2. Prepare data** | We've got some images, let's load them in with a [PyTorch `DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) so we can use them with our training loop. |\n",
    "| **3. Model 0: Building a baseline model** | Here we'll create a multi-class classification model to learn patterns in the data, we'll also choose a **loss function**, **optimizer** and build a **training loop**. | \n",
    "| **4. Making predictions and evaluating model 0** | Let's make some predictions with our baseline model and evaluate them. |\n",
    "| **5. Setup device agnostic code for future models** | It's best practice to write device-agnostic code, so let's set it up. |\n",
    "| **6. Model 1: Adding non-linearity** | Experimenting is a large part of machine learning, let's try and improve upon our baseline model by adding non-linear layers. |\n",
    "| **7. Model 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** | Time to get computer vision specific and introduce the powerful convolutional neural network architecture. |\n",
    "| **8. Comparing our models** | We've built three different models, let's compare them. |\n",
    "| **9. Evaluating our best model** | Let's make some predictions on random images and evaluate our best model. |\n",
    "| **10. Making a confusion matrix** | A confusion matrix is a great way to evaluate a classification model, let's see how we can make one. |\n",
    "| **11. Saving and loading the best performing model** | Since we might want to use our model for later, let's save it and make sure it loads back in correctly. |"
